# Memoire

Memoire is a text search/RAG solution. It handles for you all the details of making a good document retrieval so you can focus on building your app (and delight your users).

## Features

- **Perfected document retrieval**: hybrid search, structRag, Agentic chunking, Context extraction in messages, and many more done for you.
- **Easy API**: Send us texts, or send us link to downloadable documents, we handle the rest.
- **Document parsing**: forget about parsing html, xml, docx, pdfs and the gazillion document types out there, just send us a link: we download, parse and index documents for you.
- **Open source**: you can see everything we do, our company is transparent.
