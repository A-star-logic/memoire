## Features

- **Deploy in one day**: We made our API as intuitive as possible, so you can get a working RAG in a few minutes instead of months.
- **State of the art retrieval**: Benefit from the latest and best algorithms of retrieval such as hybrid search, agentic chunking, HyDE and many more.
- **Auto document parsing**: Forget about parsing html, xml, docx, pdfs and the gazillion document types out there. Memoire already does it for you.

### License & running the app

We are not open source yet. We have our [own source-available license you can read here](./LICENSE), the TLDR is:

- Today, you can use freely the software for hobby or educational purpose, but you need to pay a fee to deploy to production (we can negotiate this fee).
- Our goal is become default alive as quickly as possible.
- Once we are, the code will become open core.
- To buy a license, [book a call on our website](https://astarlogic.com?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme)
